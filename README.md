# Million.Technical.Test

To run the application, you need to apply the migrations to the database. The application is configured to point to a local SQL Server instance.

**Connection string:**
```
"DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=RealEstateDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
```

To apply the migrations, run the following commands in the solution's terminal:

1. Install `dotnet-ef` tool if not already installed:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 8.0.8
```

2. Update the database:

```
dotnet ef database update --project .\Million.Technical.Test.Infrastructure\Million.Technical.Test.Infrastructure.csproj --startup-project .\Million.Technical.Test\Million.Technical.Test.Api.csproj
```

### Next Steps:

1. **Create an Owner**:  
   You will need the Ownerâ€™s ID to create a property.
